-Improve hit detection.
	-Modify paddle code to have a ball check much like how the ball code has a paddle check.  This will allow us to prevent the ball going through
	the paddle when the paddle moves "into" the ball.  With this new code, the paddle will push the ball out of the way if it encounters it while
	moving.  For now, just make the ball bounce at a standard angle like everything else, and make sure the direction is based on which end of the
	paddle hits the ball.
-Improve accel changes based on where the ball hits the paddle.
	-If the ball is knocked out of the way by the paddle, increase speed by 1, opposite of what walls do.
	-If the ball hits a corner of the paddle, use standard paddle acceleration.
-Add in the ability for the ball to have independent X and Y velocities.
-Add a video config menu.(Maybe?)
-Remove all current music tracks and replace them with my own(and a nice music/sounds config menu).
-Add paddle sizes.
-Take another look at AI.
-Add floating score notifier.
-When a player misses the ball, their opponent gains more points the faster the ball was moving.
-Add a controls config screen.
-Reorganize settings stuff:  Options menu pops up list, this list leads to a config window for either Video, Audio, or Game Settings.
-Cool animated background.
-Make the balls beside menu options animated.
-Fix the "volume controls count as input" issue.
-Document the source code.
-Add networked multiplayer.
